1) we found some datasets on economic data
2) I'm considering a way to contruct the data in such a way that i can have
	a main table of countries with some type of ID, then with some basic attributes.
3) I may have to use excel or python to arrange the ID in such a way that i can distribute
	these same ids to other work files so we can link tables through Primary/Foreign keys
4) I've decided to use python/jupyter/pandas to create a unique ID row in the Country_profile_variables CSV so we can use it as reference.
	4.1) I've created the primary key for the file and now need a way to convert the other CSV files according to the primary keys in country_profile_variables
5) i'm trying to figure out a way to assign the foreign keys to the other data sets 
...
6) i'm going to look for other datasets then i'll try to organize the data on that.

7) I'm removing the economic commodity and economic calender files because they are very large and look tedious and man looking for smaller data sets to play with before
	using big data sets which require rigorious cleaning.

8) I'm adding an Economic Freedom dataset tfrom Kaggle to compensate for a smaller dataset and easier to handle data.

9) a recommended premise for our database, as to why we have this.
	motivation: Doing Business in other countries by combing economic/social/environment factors of data so it provides as 
			with a snapshot of which countries may or may not be favorable to do business in.
Economic:
- Tariff Data
- Purchasing Power Parity
- Ease of Doing Business
- GDP

10) I read in the basic_country_variables.csv file, made the primary key there, and then read the ranking.csv file
	a) i then matched the countries in each file to make sure both files had the same countries.
	b) once i completely matched all countries, changed the spelling for other countries to further complete the match, and properly put them into one dataframe in read_csv_ranking.df
	c) i then gave each country in read_csv_ranking.df their appropriate country_id so i could connect both the read_csv_primary and read_csv_ranking on an SQL platform
	d) I just need to upload the dataframes onto SQL via SQLalchemy
